## tennis.feather
<EM>Chapter 10, Starting with Simple Learners</EM><BR>
One of the original Ross Quinlan datasets that present and describe the ID3 algorithm in Induction of Decision Trees (1986) (http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=637969). The dataset is quite simple, consisting of only 14 observations relative to the weather conditions, with results that say whether it’s appropriate to play tennis. The example contains four features: outlook, temperature, humidity, and wind, all expressed using qualitative classes instead of measurements (you could express temperature, humidity, and wind strength numerically) to convey a more intuitive understanding of how the features relate to the outcome.

## titanic.feather
<EM>Chapter 10, Starting with Simple Learners</EM><BR>
A dataset describing the survival rates of passengers from the RMS Titanic, the British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic ocean in April 1912 after colliding with an iceberg. Various versions of the dataset exist — the version used in the example is made of few key features such as gender, age, number of siblings or spouses aboard (sibsp), number of parents or children aboard (parch) and survival expressed as a binary where one means the individual has survived.
